# Case Studies / Testimonials

## Case Study 1

Just Funded a $35,000 Credit Line Hybrid!

Credit Suite is proud that RDH Counseling and Consulting, LLC has been approved for $35,000 in Credit Line Hybrid Financing.

### RDH’s Background

Rachel Hunter is a Licensed Clinical 
Social Worker, Certified Life Coach, and owner of RDH Counseling and 
Consulting, LLC. She is passionate about healing, educating and 
empowering others through therapy, coaching, training and courses.

After working for years as a social 
worker, she realized she had to do something more to help with the 
issues she saw on a daily basis. Two years ago, that became a reality 
when she founded RDH Counseling and Consulting.

But, the world was soon slammed into 
an unprecedented shutdown due to the then-novel COVID-19. Seeing clients
 in the office quickly became an unexpected challenge. It was apparent 
that to keep helping, in the midst of a need that was growing daily due 
to shut downs and isolation, she was going to have to find a way to 
pivot and operate her business virtually.

### Funding 30 Challenge & RDH’s Financing

Rachel heard about the Credit Suite 
Funding 30 Challenge through the Get Business Credit Facebook group. She
 signed up and learned a ton from the many speakers over the course of 
the week. Inspired, she contacted Credit Suite about funding. After 
working with the Finance Specialists, Credit Suite got her $35,000 for 
her business in the form of Credit Line Hybrid. A Credit Line Hybrid is a
 series of credit cards that have introductory rates of 0% for 
6-18months and can even provide cash in hand for the business.

### The Rest Is History… and Future

Now, Rachel has the funds to invest 
in new equipment and set up her business for success virtually. She can 
offer consulting, counseling, training and more with clients not ever 
having to leave their home, if they so choose. This is a huge step and 
one that will allow the business to grow, thrive, and accommodate 
whatever may come.  Congratulations Rachel!

## Case Study 2

Before venturing into the 
micropigmentation business, Benaiah Poindexter had a background as a 
senior procurement specialist working as a government contractor. Armed 
with a master’s degree in business, Benaiah had already laid the 
groundwork for entrepreneurship through business classes. The decision 
to enter the micropigmentation industry was influenced by mentorship and
 observing the positive impact of the craft on individuals’ lives.

“One of my mentors had a location in 
Bethesda, Maryland and we had been friends online for a while. I was 
interested in what he did and I thought it was a great service that he 
provided. I just didn’t know if that was something that I would be 
interested in. But he convinced me to take a class and asked me to come 
down for a few weeks. So, I did! Once I saw his clientele, saw what he 
was doing, saw how happy they were, [and] saw he was changing lives…I 
decided this is something I wanted to be a part of.”

Hair loss can be addressed through

craft and business model. This move towards education and mentorship 
demonstrates Scalp Prodigy’s commitment to sharing their expertise and 
contributing to the growth of the micropigmentation industry.

“We are doing master classes with 
students that are trying to learn our craft and we basically are cutting
 the learning phase by letting them mimic our business model. So we are 
getting more into training and mentorship and allowing them to see how 
the back end of our business is run so they can actually get the 
business process,” Benaiah explains.

## Testimonial 1

My name is Junius Bennett. I am the CEO of Nu Life Veterans LLC. My experience with Credit Suite has been amazing. I started my business out of pain because I was an injured veteran myself, and I had no one to help me through the process of filing a disability claim. Most veterans are underrated. In fact, eight out of ten of them. A little while later. So I saw that there was a problem. And I’m providing a solution.

When I help someone get 100% and their children can go to college at age 18, they get a check in their own name. Their spouse can go back to college and get a degree because they got disabled. I happened to see Credit Suite’s ad on Facebook, the CEO of Credit Suite, Mr. Ty Crandall. I knew that he was an Air Force veteran, and I’m a veteran myself. I’m a Navy veteran. So I kind of trusted that the moment that I signed up with credits, we I got a phone call from the credit advisors.

Welcome to Credit Suite. And what’s my next step for Credit Suite what accounts is the platform for let’s get your business fundable credible in front of these lenders. When you enroll in a program, you lose a loan, or they call you and tell you what to do. So I didn’t feel alone. So I felt more empowered, if you will, to go ahead and continue with the service. But as a business owner, you’re going to need funding. You’re going to need capital to expand, grow, and scale your business.

So I enrolled into that service in 2021, and they had a straight a suite of advisors to help me get my credit, Fundability, credibility, and everything together. And once I did that, oh man, the sky’s the limit. I’m not only got universal credit lines; I also have lines of credit.

I just got BMW to finance a brand new 2023 M8 competition convertible and also an unlimited American Express business platinum card. I’m up my advertising budget by probably 1024 on a weekly basis because of that line of credit. I’m going to be buying equipment for doing podcasts in my office. I’ve gotten a lot of things done through credits. What that allows me to do was expand my business. So I’m excited about what they’ve done for me.

## Testimonials 2

Josh Elledge

Orlando, FL

Entrepreneurialism
 has just always been in my blood. My dad was a business owner, my 
Grandma was a business owner. My great great grandfather, Amos Ellis, 
was a proprietor and sold blocks of ice. I failed in business six times.
 But on that seventh business venture actually made many millions of 
dollars. And I think it’s because of those experiences, those failures 
and grinding it out and doing what other people are not willing to do. 
That kept me learning. That kept me improving and kept me kind of 
figuring out exactly who I needed to be so that I could succeed in 
business.

When you have growth opportunities and you need to make hires and you
 need to maybe purchase more inventory, you need to invest in technology
 or new platforms. And that’s where a thing to meet the demands of that 
growth. Well, that eats up cash. And so even though you might be making a
 lot more money, your profits might actually temporarily take a hit, 
which is really important that you are working and surrounding yourself 
with smart financial people, smart financial platforms- so that you can 
create a buffer so that you can invest in smart growth.

So when we started with Credit Suite, you know, one thing that’s just
 beautiful about the way that this has been designed is you start with 
baby steps. And so the first things that we did is we got a couple of 
revolving credit lines. We got some store credit at some at some 
businesses that were really easy to get those things. And then from 
there we graduated and then we got some gas cards. And then we ended up 
getting a very nice line of credit at Amazon. And then eventually we 
worked our way up to getting a very, very nice SBA loan, which is a no 
brainer. Thanks to Credit Suite, we were able to really get our business
 finances in order and not just from an accounting standpoint, but from a
 “what looks good” to potential lenders and potential creditors. And so 
because we were able to use the Credit Suite platform and really design 
that very well, well, we became very attractive to lenders. And this is 
really important because there are a lot of predatory lenders out there 
and they’d be happy to give you money as a business. But what ends up 
happening is if you’re now faced with, you know, 25, 30 percent interest
 or more, which is very, very common in the business lending world, it’s
 really hard to pay interest rates at that level when there are so many 
other options out there.

But the best options are always available to those who have their 
credit game locked down. And that’s what the Credit Suite platform 
allows you to do. We’ve been able to make smart investments in staffing,
 marketing systems, sales systems, product development, all of these 
things that before Credit Suite or before having access to capital we 
really couldn’t do. I just don’t have to stress as much because we’ve 
got money in the bank to take care of the opportunity. I’m not as 
stressed anymore. You know, I can keep a bank account that has plenty of
 cushion in there. And that cushion just honestly, it makes me a better 
dad. It makes me a better husband. I’m not stressing out about the bank 
account.

Spend some time and get to learn from, you know, some of the amazing 
minds that are part of Credit Suite. And you’ll learn very quickly that 
they care about the audience that they serve. Wait till you become a 
Credit Suite member, because now you’ve got someone, you know, who’s 
going to you’re going to it’s going to hold your hand and step you 
through every- you know, all the things you’ve been learning about. 
You’re now going to have a guide, a mentor who is going to guide you 
through all those processes to make sure that things are working out in 
your favor. And I can tell you for us, it is honestly one of the 
smartest investments we made.

I went to my credit union, I went to my bank. I, you know, looked at 
all the junk mail and then I’d find out these ridiculous interest rates 
on lines of credit. And, you know, this financing, alternative business 
financing was really expensive. Thanks to Credit Suite, I was able to 
use their platform and get access to capital with lenders that wanted to
 work with me, bring in the Credit Suite team, allow them to advise you 
on the best financing vehicles. Help them. Get, you know, let them help 
you get your your business Ps and Qs in order so that you can make the 
smartest decisions when it comes to your money.
